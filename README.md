## Install

The script **install.sh** can auto-install all for you (and also auto update/repair an instalation) :

**1.** Create on your disk an empty target folder with around 50GB free space:
```
cd $HOME
mkdir peppercarrot
cd peppercarrot
```
**2.** Clone the repository in a folder named 'scripts' and launch the install.sh script:
```
git clone https://github.com/Deevad/peppercarrot.git scripts
cd scripts
./install.sh
```
**3.** At the first run, the script should create a new configuration file **config.sh** along **install.sh** and stop inviting you to edit it. Here I edit it with the CLI editor 'nano' :
```
nano config.sh
```
Change ```export projectroot="/home/username/peppercarrot"``` to the root of your instalation folder ( where you created the 'peppercarrot' folder). Save the configuration file, and launch again the script again. Voilà, time for getting a coffee in front of long instalation process.

_Note: You can also optionaly setup FTP login and password in this configuration file, if you want to sync with LFTP the local rendered pages to a distant server._

After install, here is how look like a basic file tree of a **Pepper&Carrot project** correctly installed :

```
peppercarrot/
├── fonts (git)
├── scripts (git)
├── webcomics
│   └── ep01_Potion-of-Flight
│   │   ├── lang (git)
│   │   └── zip
│   └── ep02_Rainbow-potions
│   │   ├── lang (git)
│   │   └── zip
│   └── ep03_The-secret-ingredients
│       ├── lang (git)
│       └── zip
├── wiki (git)
└── www-lang (git)
```

_Note: On this example, only three episodes subfolder are visible to keep the example tree compact._

## Usage

A [launcher](http://www.peppercarrot.com/data/images/lab/2015-10-15-peppercarrot-script/2015-10-15_peppercarrot-script_screenshot_000_net.jpg) was copied into your system in  ```$HOME/.local/share/applications/peppercarrot-menu.desktop``` .

All operating system's menu should catch this type of launcher. So, open your menu to access **Peppercarrot main menu** ( under the programming/development category ). An [interface](http://www.peppercarrot.com/data/images/lab/2015-10-15-peppercarrot-script/2015-10-15_peppercarrot-script_screenshot_001_net.jpg) will pop-up and guide you to select an action ( eg. Select an episode, then render it ).

## Update

 Run again ```scripts/install.sh```, or from the launcher GUI select the option 'update everything'.
